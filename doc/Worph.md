## Game Play

The game begins when a player draws a card from the Worph beginnings deck. That player should place the three tiles that spell that word in the center of the game board. The player to the left then spins the Worph Letter/Point Spinner.

The Worph Letter/Point Spinner has point values associated with groups of letters as follows;

1 = E T A O I N S H R

2 = D L C U M

3 = W F G Y

4 = P B V

5 = K J

6 = X Q Z

Start the timer. The player now has 30 seconds to add or replace a single letter at any location on the table word with any letter from the tile holder to make a new word.

Once a word is played, that word cannot be used again.

Adding the letter &quot;S&quot; to the end of a word to make a plural is not allowed. Replacing a letter at the end of a word with an &quot;S&quot; is allowed. For example;

- &quot;Mate&quot; to &quot;mates&quot; is not allowed
- &quot;Mate&quot; to &quot;mats&quot; is allowed

If the player cannot Worph the table word in the allotted time, play passes to the next player on the left.

## Scoring

- 1 point - Changing a letter at the beginning or end of the table word (outside change).
- 2 points – Changing a letter inside the table word (not the first or last letter) (inside change)
- 2 point – Adding a letter to the beginning or end of the table word (outside add)
- 3 points – Adding a letter inside the table word (inside add)

Bonus points:

If the new letter added to the table word matches a letter on that player&#39;s Worph Letter/Point Spinner, those points are added to the total score.

## Examples

1. The table word is &quot;Later&quot;. The player spins the Worph Letter/Point Spinner which lands on 5 (K,J). The player can&#39;t come up with a way to use K or J so decides to make the word &quot;Latter&quot; by adding a &quot;T&quot;. The points for this are;

- 3 points for adding a letter inside the table word.

1. The table word is &quot;Later&quot;. The player spins the Worph Letter/Point Spinner which lands on 6 (X,Q,Z). The player makes the word &quot;Latex&quot;. The points for this are;

- 1 point - Changing a letter at the beginning or end of the table word.

### Plus

- 6 points – Bonus for using the Worph Letter/Point Spinner letter.
- 7 total points are scored.

At the end of the turn, the player to the left spins the Worph Letter/Point Spinner and begins his/her turn.

If a player cannot place a tile, that player passes his/her turn to the next player.

## Game End

The game ends when the table word can no longer be changed by any player. The player with the most points wins.
